## II. Airbnb 2016 Project

In this project, I learned from Alex The Analyst's YouTube channel, where I created 5 different visual charts to see how various factors affect house rental prices:

- Symbol Maps: Display average rental prices by zipcode
- Maps: Show maps by area with average prices, through which you can see the average prices by geographic regions and which locations have expensive rental prices
- Lines: When do people spend the most money on house rentals
(For example, the chart shows that rental prices are very low at the beginning of the year, but from summer onwards to the end of the year, rental prices become very high => should rent out houses during that time)
- Bar chart: Average price per bedroom (shows that houses with more bedrooms have higher prices)
- Text table: Number of available bedrooms (See how many bedrooms competitors have)

And this is what I learned during my journey to becoming a data analyst. I hope it will help me greatly in my future career.
